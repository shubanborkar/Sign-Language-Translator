Project Overview
The Sign Language Recognition System is an innovative tool that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret hand gestures, converting them into readable text or audible speech in real time. This project aims to enhance accessibility and foster inclusive communication by providing an efficient and scalable solution for sign language translation.
Inspired by open-source initiatives, this project builds upon foundational concepts but introduces optimized algorithms, improved model accuracy, and a more intuitive user interface. It is designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in accessibility technology and machine learning.
Features

Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Accurately detects and translates sign language gestures in real time using a webcam or video input.
Multi-Language Support: Supports multiple sign language alphabets (e.g., ASL, BSL) with customizable configurations.
High Accuracy: Leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset for robust performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive GUI for seamless user interaction.
Extensible Design: Modular codebase allows easy integration of new features or additional sign language datasets.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for model development and application logic.
OpenCV: For real-time image processing and hand gesture detection.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
MediaPipe: For precise hand landmark detection.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
PyQt: For the graphical user interface.
Jupyter Notebooks: For model experimentation and visualization.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download the Pre-trained Model:Download the pre-trained model weights from this link and place them in the models/ directory.

Verify Installation:Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:
python -m scripts.verify_installation



Usage

Run the Application:Launch the main application with:
python main.py


Interact with the System:

Open the GUI and select the desired sign language mode (e.g., ASL).
Use your webcam to perform sign language gestures.
The system will display the translated text in real time on the interface.


Command-Line Mode (optional):For developers, run the recognition system in terminal mode:
python scripts/recognize.py --input webcam


Sample Output:
Detected Gesture: A
Confidence: 0.98



Dataset
The system is trained on a custom dataset of sign language gestures, comprising thousands of labeled images across multiple sign language alphabets. The dataset includes:

ASL Alphabet: 26 letters (A-Z) with over 10,000 images per class.
BSL Alphabet: Support for British Sign Language gestures.
Custom Gestures: Extensible for additional signs or custom datasets.

To use your own dataset:

Place images in the data/ directory following the structure: data/<sign_name>/image.jpg.
Update the configuration file in config/dataset.yaml to include your dataset details.
Run the preprocessing script:python scripts/preprocess_data.py



Training the Model
To train or fine-tune the model:

Ensure your dataset is prepared as described above.
Modify hyperparameters in config/model.yaml if needed.
Run the training script:python scripts/train_model.py


Monitor training progress using TensorBoard:tensorboard --logdir logs/



The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.
